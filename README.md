## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/insta-follower-bot.git](https://github.com/your-username/insta-follower-bot.git)
cd insta-follower-bot
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
This keeps your project's dependencies separate from your system.

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create .env Configuration File
Create a file named .env in the same directory. This script will read your credentials and target account from here.
```code snippet
# .env file
SIMILAR_ACCOUNT="target_account_username"
USERNAME="your_instagram_username"
PASSWORD="your_instagram_password"
```
üèÉ Running the Bot
Once you have installed the dependencies and configured your .env file, simply run the main Python script:

```Bash
python main.py
```
